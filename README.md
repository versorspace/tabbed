# tabbed - generic tabbed interface

### Patches/Mods in this fork of suckless's tabbed:

* -n sets the window class just like -c in st
* alpha patch

### Keybindings:

* Ctrl-Shift-Returns spawns new tab
* Ctrl-Shift-L/H to move left/right (like vim bindings)

### How I launch st with tabbed:

`tabbed -c -n dwmalto  st -w`

```
-c : close tabbed program when there are no windows inside it
-n : sets window name and class
```
